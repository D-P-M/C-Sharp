/* while loops are good when you know your stopping condition, 
but not when you know how many times you want a program to loop 
or if you have a specific collection to loop through.

do...while loops are only necessary if you definitely want something to run once, 
but then stop if a condition is met.

for loops are best if you want something to run a specific number of times, 
rather than given a certain condition.

foreach loops are the best way to loop over an array, or any other collection.



A loop is a structure in programming where the instructions are written once, 
but a computer can execute them multiple times

Each execution of those instructions is called an iteration

while loops repeat until a condition changes

do...while loops execute once, and then repeat until a condition changes

for loops repeat for a specified number of times

foreach loops repeat for each item in a collection

jump statements, like break, continue, and return are used to add additional control flow to loops
